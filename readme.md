# UMass Dining API

A WIP GraphQL api to access information about the dining hall's offerings.

The goal of this project is to allow more flexible access to dining hall information while keeping the load on UMass's server to a minimum.

Thanks to https://github.com/simon-andrews/umass-toolkit for finding the API endpoints this project scrapes.
